*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Framework:** Genkit (by Google)
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@genkit-ai/googleai`)
*   **3D Graphics:** Three.js, **@tensorflow-models/body-pix** (for advanced webcam processing)
*   **State Management:** React Context API (e.g., `SettingsProvider`, `AudioDataProvider`, `SceneProvider`)
*   **Data Fetching/Caching:** TanStack Query (formerly React Query)
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier (configured in `package.json`)
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (recommended for Next.js) or Firebase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or higher recommended, as per `package.json`'s `@types/node": "^20"`)
*   `npm` (comes with Node.js) or `yarn`
*   A Google AI API Key for Genkit integration. Ensure you have access to Google AI services.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    **Important:** Replace `<repository-url>` in the command below with the actual URL of this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd your-repository-name # Replace 'your-repository-name' with the actual folder name created by git clone
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file (if one is provided, otherwise create it manually).
    Add your Google AI API Key:
    ```env
    # .env.local
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"

    # Optional: Specify a different port for the Next.js app (defaults to 9002 as per package.json script)
    # PORT=9002
    ```
    Refer to the Configuration section for more details on environment variables.

### Running the Application
To start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or the `PORT` you specified).

### Genkit Development Server
Genkit is a framework that helps you build, deploy, and manage AI applications. It runs its own development UI for testing and managing AI flows.
To start the Genkit development server:
```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```
This server runs separately (usually on `http://localhost:4000`) and is used for interacting with and testing your AI flows locally.

## Project Structure
*   `src/app/`: Main application pages (Next.js App Router).
*   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
    *   `control-panel/`: UI for controlling visualizations and AI tools.
    *   `visualizer/`: Components for rendering visualizations (2D/WebGL).
    *   `ui/`: Generic UI elements (buttons, sliders, etc. - likely from a library like shadcn/ui given the file names).
*   `src/ai/`: AI-related logic, including Genkit flows.
    *   `genkit.ts`: Genkit initialization.
    *   `flows/`: Specific AI tasks (e.g., `generate-assets-from-prompt.ts`).
*   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and constants.
    *   `constants.ts`: Contains scene definitions, including webcam integration logic.
*   `src/providers/`: React Context providers for global state management.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
*   `public/`: Static assets.
*   `docs/`: Project documentation (e.g., `blueprint.md`).
*   `pages/api/`: While Next.js traditionally uses this for API routes, Genkit operates its own server, so primary AI backend logic will be managed through Genkit flows rather than Next.js API routes in this directory.

## Code Architecture
The project follows a modern frontend architecture, leveraging Next.js conventions and best practices for building a scalable and maintainable application.

### Modular Structure
*   **Next.js Layout:** Utilizes a clear Next.js application layout defined in `src/app/layout.tsx`, which serves as the entry point for global styles and context providers.
*   **Global Styling:** TailwindCSS is used for global styling, configured in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **State Management with React Context:** Application state is managed using React Context providers. For example, `SceneProvider` (from `src/providers/SceneProvider.tsx`) holds the available visualizer scenes and the currently active scene. It exposes functions like `registerScene` and `setCurrentSceneById`, promoting a clean separation of UI, state, and core logic.

### Theming and Styling
*   **TailwindCSS Configuration:** TailwindCSS is configured with explicit content paths in `tailwind.config.ts` to ensure efficient purging of unused styles in production builds.
*   **Custom Branding:** Custom CSS variables for application-specific colors and fonts are defined in `src/lib/brandingConstants.ts`, allowing for centralized theme management.
*   **Font Optimization:** Fonts, including Poppins from Google Fonts and custom local fonts ("Data70", "Torus" located in `src/app/fonts/`), are handled via Next.js's `next/font` module for optimized loading and performance.

### Type-Safe AI Flows
*   **Genkit Integration:** The `src/ai/` directory houses Genkit "flows," which orchestrate AI-driven tasks.
*   **Schema Definition:** Each flow (e.g., `generate-harmonious-palettes.ts` in `src/ai/flows/`) defines input and output schemas using Zod. This ensures type safety for data passed to and from the AI models.
*   **Contextual Prompts:** Prompt definitions within these flows often embed thematic context (e.g., "Cosmic Grapevines" for palette generation) and incorporate safety filters to guide AI responses.

### Recommendation for Refactoring (Code Architecture)
*   **Shared Safety Settings:** The project evaluation report identified an opportunity for improvement: `defaultSafetySettings` arrays are currently duplicated across multiple AI flows. Refactoring these into a shared constant (e.g., in `src/ai/sharedConstants.ts` or similar) would enhance maintainability and reduce redundancy.

## Visualizer
The core of the application, responsible for rendering the graphics. This section describes the main components related to the visual output.

### Rendering Modes (2D Canvas & WebGL)
*   The `VisualizerView.tsx` component dynamically switches between 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering.
*   Individual scenes specify their preferred renderer type (`rendererType: '2d' | 'webgl'`).
*   **Three.js** is employed for WebGL rendering, allowing for sophisticated 3D graphics and effects.

### Scene Management
*   The `SceneProvider` (React Context) manages the collection of available visual scenes and the currently active scene.
*   Scenes are defined in `src/lib/constants.ts` and are modular, with dedicated functions for initialization (`initWebGL`), drawing (`drawWebGL`), and cleanup (`cleanupWebGL`).
*   Smooth transitions between different scenes are supported.

### Audio Responsiveness
*   The `AudioDataProvider` (React Context) processes microphone or audio file input in real-time.
*   It provides crucial audio data like Root Mean Square (RMS) for volume, beat detection, and frequency spectrum analysis (e.g., bass, mid, treble).
*   Visualizations use this data to react dynamically, creating a tightly synchronized audio-visual experience.

### Webcam Integration
The `WebcamFeed.tsx` component facilitates access to the user's webcam. The live webcam feed is integrated into various visual scenes, enhancing interactivity and personalization. All webcam features are controlled via the "Show Webcam" toggle in the UI settings.

*   **Mirror Silhouette (Primary Webcam Scene):**
    *   Uses **BodyPix** (from TensorFlow Models) for real-time person segmentation.
    *   This allows for a precise silhouette of the user, which is then colored and styled based on audio input.
    *   Technique: `bodyPix.segmentPerson()` generates a mask, which is drawn to an offscreen canvas and used as a `THREE.CanvasTexture` in a custom shader.

*   **Echoing Shapes:**
    *   Detects motion by comparing consecutive frames from the webcam feed on a downscaled 2D canvas (`motionCanvas`).
    *   Shapes are spawned at the locations of detected motion, with their size and lifetime potentially influenced by the amount of motion and audio properties.
    *   Technique: Frame differencing on a 2D canvas (`motionCtx.getImageData()`).

*   **Frequency Rings:**
    *   The expanding rings are textured with the live webcam feed.
    *   This webcam texture is blended (mixed) with the audio-reactive base colors of the rings.
    *   Technique: `THREE.VideoTexture` is used as a map in a `THREE.ShaderMaterial`, with UV adjustments for aspect ratio.

*   **Neon Pulse Grid:**
    *   Grid cell colors are influenced by the webcam feed.
    *   Each cell samples a corresponding pixel from a downscaled representation of the webcam image (`textureSampleCanvas` of size `GRID_SIZE_X` x `GRID_SIZE_Y`).
    *   The sampled webcam color is then blended with the cell's audio-reactive color.
    *   Technique: Drawing webcam to a small canvas, `getImageData()`, then blending colors for each cell's `targetColor`.

*   **Spectrum Bars:**
    *   The colors of the audio spectrum bars are a blend of their original audio-driven colors and colors sampled from the webcam feed.
    *   Each bar samples its color from a corresponding vertical slice of the webcam image (achieved by drawing the webcam feed to a 1px high canvas, `barSampleCanvas`, with width equal to `numBars`).
    *   Technique: Drawing webcam to a `numBars` x 1px canvas, `getImageData()`, then blending with audio-reactive HSL colors.

*   **Radial Burst:**
    *   The colors of newly spawned particles are a 50/50 blend of their audio-driven hues and colors randomly sampled from a downscaled (64x64 `particleSampleCanvas`) version of the webcam feed.
    *   Technique: Random pixel sampling from `getImageData()` of the sample canvas, blended with audio-driven HSL colors.

*   **Geometric Tunnel:**
    *   The interior walls of the tunnel segments are textured with the live webcam feed when the webcam is active.
    *   This webcam texture is tinted by the audio-reactive colors that normally drive the wireframe.
    *   Technique: Material swapping; `THREE.VideoTexture` is applied to a `MeshBasicMaterial` on the tunnel segments, with `color` property tinted by audio. Texture coordinates (`repeat`, `offset`) are adjusted for mirroring and aspect ratio.

*   **Strobe Light:**
    *   In addition to audio beats, strobe flashes can now be triggered by sudden significant increases in the overall brightness of the webcam feed.
    *   Technique: Average brightness is calculated from a downscaled (16x16 `brightnessSampleCanvas`) webcam image each frame. A large delta from the previous frame's brightness triggers the strobe.

*   **Particle Finale:**
    *   Similar to "Radial Burst," particle colors are a blend of their audio-driven hues and colors randomly sampled from a downscaled (64x64 `finaleSampleCanvas`) webcam feed. This creates a dynamic, colorful explosion influenced by both audio and live video.
    *   Technique: Random pixel sampling from `getImageData()` of the sample canvas, blended with audio-driven HSL colors for particles.

### AI Overlays
*   Supports displaying AI-generated images as overlays on top of the current visualizer scene (via `settings.aiGeneratedOverlayUri`).
*   Users can adjust blend modes and opacity for these overlays through the control panel.

## Configuration
This section details how to configure the application, including environment variables and application-specific settings accessible through the UI.

### Environment Variables
*   Environment variables are managed using a `.env.local` file in the project root (for Next.js).
*   **Primary required variable:**
    ```env
    # .env.local
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY" # Your Google AI API Key for Genkit
    ```
*   It's good practice to create a `.env.example` file (not currently in the project) to list all required environment variables.
*   Other optional variables (e.g., `PORT` for the Next.js app, which defaults to 9002 as per `package.json` script `dev`) can also be defined here.

### Application Settings
*   Global application settings are managed via the `SettingsProvider` (React Context) and are configurable through the UI control panel.
*   These settings encompass parameters for:
    *   **Visuals:** Active scene, rendering mode (2D/WebGL), specific scene properties.
    *   **Audio Input:** Microphone sensitivity, beat detection thresholds, FFT smoothing.
    *   **AI Interactions:** Prompts for asset generation, selected AI overlays, blend modes, opacity.
    *   **Webcam:** Toggle webcam visibility (`showWebcam`), mirror webcam (`mirrorWebcam`).
    *   **UI/Branding:** Theme options, visibility of branding elements.

## AI/ML Integration & Components
The application leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to enhance the user experience by dynamically generating visual content and suggestions.

### Core Technology
*   **Genkit Framework:** AI functionality is orchestrated using [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit), an open-source framework by Google for building production-ready AI applications with Node.js/TypeScript.
*   **Google Gemini Model:** The primary AI model utilized is Google's Gemini, specifically `googleai/gemini-1.5-flash` (as configured in `src/ai/genkit.ts`), offering a balance of performance and capability for tasks like text-to-image generation and creative suggestions.

### Prompt Engineering & Schemas
*   **Contextual Prompts:** Prompts sent to the AI model are carefully engineered to be context-aware. For instance, prompts for generating scene ambiance dynamically include the current scene's name and relevant audio features (e.g., RMS, beat, frequency data) to tailor suggestions.
*   **Structured Outputs with Zod:** To ensure type safety and predictable results, the inputs and outputs of AI flows are defined and validated using Zod schemas. This is evident in flows like `generate-harmonious-palettes.ts` (`src/ai/flows/generate-harmonious-palettes.ts`), where Zod schemas constrain the format of generated color palettes.
*   **Prompt Maintainability:** The project evaluation noted that prompt strings are currently embedded inline within the flow definitions. For improved maintainability and easier internationalization (i18n), it is recommended to extract these strings into dedicated constants or resource files.

### Caching of AI Outputs
*   **In-Memory Caching:** To optimize performance and reduce redundant API calls to the Gemini model, AI flow results are cached in memory. This is typically implemented using JavaScript `Map` objects, where the cache key is derived from the input parameters of the flow.
*   **Cache Logging:** Logs within the flows (e.g., in `generateHarmoniousPalettesFlow`) indicate whether a response was served from the cache ("cache hit") or generated by a new AI call ("cache miss").

*   **Critical Refactoring Note on Caching:**
    > **Warning:** The project evaluation highlighted a critical area for refactoring regarding cache key generation. Several cache keys currently omit important contextual information, which can lead to stale or incorrect suggestions being served from the cache.
    > *   For example, the `generateSceneAmbianceFlow` uses only the scene ID/name as a cache key, ignoring the dynamic `audioData` that significantly influences the desired ambiance.
    > *   Similarly, the `generateVisualOverlayFlow`'s cache key omits the `audioContext`.
    > **Recommendation:** It is strongly recommended to revise cache key generation to include all relevant inputs (such as audio features, full prompt text, and other dynamic parameters). If comprehensive cache keying is too complex for certain flows, consider disabling caching for those specific flows to ensure responsive and context-aware AI results.

### Ethical Safeguards
*   **Content Safety Settings:** Standard safety settings are configured for each AI prompt to block the generation of harmful content, including hate speech, harassment, sexually explicit material, and dangerous content. These settings are applied directly in the Genkit flow configurations.
*   **Future Enhancements for Safeguards:** The project evaluation suggests enhancing these safeguards by:
    *   Logging any instances where content is filtered by the safety settings or when users report concerns.
    *   Potentially integrating tools like MLflow to track prompt inputs/outputs over time, helping to monitor for and mitigate issues like bias or model drift.

### Inference Speed Monitoring
*   **Execution Time Logging:** Each AI flow measures and logs its execution time using `performance.now()`. This provides a basic measure of the latency involved in generating AI responses.
*   **Recommendations for Monitoring:** The evaluation pointed out the absence of formal benchmarking tests or dedicated monitoring dashboards for AI call latency, throughput, and error rates. Implementing these would provide better insights into the performance of AI components and help identify bottlenecks.

## Performance Considerations
This section outlines key performance aspects of the application, potential bottlenecks, and recommendations for optimization, drawing heavily from the project evaluation.

### Runtime Efficiency
*   **Rendering Engine:** The visualizer leverages WebGL for rendering, primarily through the **Three.js** library, which is suitable for performant 2D and 3D graphics in the browser.
*   **Asynchronous AI Flows:** AI-driven functionalities (Genkit flows) are designed to be asynchronous and non-blocking, preventing them from freezing the user interface during AI model interactions.
*   **Accessibility & Page Load:** The application incorporates accessibility features such as a "Skip to main content" link and is designed to avoid blocking JavaScript calls during initial page load, contributing to a smoother startup experience.

### Resource Usage
*   **In-Memory Caching Concerns:**
    *   **Unbounded Growth:** A significant concern highlighted in the evaluation is the use of in-memory caches for each AI flow (e.g., for palettes, scene ambiances). These caches currently lack eviction strategies or size limits, meaning they can grow indefinitely during long user sessions, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption.
    *   **Recommendation:** It is **strongly recommended to implement cache eviction policies** (e.g., Least Recently Used - LRU) or set maximum size limits for these in-memory caches to prevent memory exhaustion.
*   **Management of Generated Assets:**
    *   Visual assets generated for scenes (e.g., textures, 3D meshes) can also accumulate in memory.
    *   **Recommendation:** Effective cleanup mechanisms for these assets are crucial, especially when users frequently switch between scenes or regenerate elements within a single session. This involves ensuring WebGL resources are properly disposed of when no longer needed.

### Scalability
*   **Load Testing:** The project evaluation found no evidence of formal load testing.
*   **API Rate Limits:** Under high user traffic, the application might encounter API rate limits for external AI services like Google Gemini. Strategies such as client-side throttling, thoughtful caching (with the above caveats), or user-specific API key configurations (if applicable) might be necessary.
*   **Adaptive Performance (Future Enhancement):**
    *   The `docs/blueprint.md` mentions an "Adaptive Watchdog" concept intended to throttle FFT analysis or shader complexity if the application's FPS drops below a target (e.g., 50 FPS).
    *   **Status:** This feature is currently unimplemented.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implementing a real-time FPS monitor and a fallback mechanism (e.g., reducing visual complexity or AI processing frequency) when performance degrades would significantly improve application robustness and user experience on less powerful hardware.

### Performance Regression Path & Testing
*   **Risk of Regressions:** Without structured performance testing, there's a risk that future changes (e.g., increased scene complexity, new AI features) could inadvertently introduce performance regressions (slower frame rates, higher memory usage) that go unnoticed.
*   **Recommendations for Testing:**
    *   **Automated Benchmarks:** The evaluation **strongly recommends setting up automated performance tests**. This could involve:
        *   Benchmarking critical JavaScript functions, especially those related to AI calls or intensive computations (e.g., using `pytest-benchmark` if Python is used for scripting tests, or equivalent JavaScript benchmarking libraries).
        *   Simulating workloads, such as measuring frame times, scene loading times, and memory usage under specific conditions or after a sequence of user actions.
    *   Regularly running these benchmarks can help identify and address performance issues proactively.

## Feature Roadmap & Documentation Gaps
This section outlines planned features, identifies current gaps in functionality and documentation, and suggests paths for future development, based on the project evaluation and existing documentation like `docs/blueprint.md`.

### Blueprint Reference & Current Scope
*   The `docs/blueprint.md` file details an ambitious vision for the project, outlining many advanced features and capabilities.
*   The project evaluation highlighted a significant disparity between this extensive blueprint and the features currently implemented. This indicates that much of the envisioned functionality represents future development work.

### Key Missing Features & Implementation Gaps
Many features detailed in the blueprint or identified as desirable are not yet implemented. Key examples include:
*   **Art-Net DMX Output:** Control of external lighting systems via Art-Net/DMX.
*   **Adaptive Performance Watchdog:** Real-time FPS monitoring with mechanisms to throttle visual complexity or AI processing if performance drops (currently mentioned in `docs/blueprint.md` but not implemented).
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Advanced client-side logging (e.g., using IndexedDB for FRP logs or detailed interaction logs).
*   **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Lack of undo/redo capabilities in the control panel for user actions.
*   **Full Mobile Support:** While the application might be viewable on mobile, dedicated responsive design and performance optimization for mobile devices are not fully realized.
*   **Style-Transfer Shader:** The "Style-Transfer Shader" is noted as a placeholder in `docs/blueprint.md` and awaits implementation.
*   **Localization (i18n) Support:** The application currently lacks infrastructure for internationalization and localization.
*   **Advanced Webcam Features:** While many webcam integrations are now present, more advanced features like chroma-keying or depth-sensing (if hardware allows) are future possibilities.

### Development Tooling & Process Gaps
*   **Testing Framework:** Absence of formal test suites (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests). The evaluation strongly recommends establishing these to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** No Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is configured, which would automate testing and deployment processes.
*   **Static & Dynamic Analysis:** The evaluation recommended integrating tools like CodeQL for automated security analysis.

### Documentation Status
*   **Initial README:** Prior to this current documentation effort, the `README.md` was minimal.
*   **Current README Enhancement:** This README has been significantly updated to reflect insights from the project evaluation and recent feature additions (especially webcam integrations), providing a more comprehensive overview.
*   **Further Documentation Needs:**
    *   **Inline Code Comments:** More detailed inline comments explaining complex logic within the codebase would aid maintainability.
    *   **Blueprint Expansion:** The `docs/blueprint.md` could be further detailed or broken down into more specific design documents.
    *   **Wiki/Developer Guide:** A dedicated wiki or developer guide could be beneficial for contributors, covering architecture, development setup, and contribution guidelines in more depth.

### Project Management & Contribution Strategy
*   **Issue Tracking:** The evaluation strongly recommended creating GitHub Issues for each major feature gap, unimplemented item from `docs/blueprint.md`, and identified refactoring needs (like the caching issues). This would:
    *   Provide a clear backlog of work.
    *   Allow for prioritization.
    *   Make it easier for potential contributors to find tasks.
*   **Roadmap Definition:** Establishing a public project roadmap with defined milestones (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) would help align development efforts and manage expectations.

### Stakeholder Communication
*   For non-technical stakeholders, it's important to communicate that while the current application provides a foundational experience, many of the most innovative and advanced features (as detailed in `docs/blueprint.md`) are part of the future vision and require further development. The current state is a stepping stone towards a much richer planned feature set.

## Key Recommendations
This section summarizes critical recommendations from the project evaluation, categorized by priority, to guide future development and enhance the application's stability, performance, and maintainability.

### High-Priority / Quick Wins
These are critical fixes and foundational improvements that address significant issues or provide high value with relatively moderate effort.

*   **Critical: Fix AI Cache Keys:**
    *   **Action:** Immediately revise the cache key generation logic for AI flows, particularly `generateSceneAmbianceFlow` and `generateVisualOverlayFlow`. Ensure cache keys include *all* relevant contextual inputs (e.g., full prompt text, dynamic audio data, scene parameters).
    *   **Impact:** Prevents serving stale or incorrect AI-generated content, which is crucial for a responsive and contextually accurate user experience.
    *   **Alternative:** If comprehensive cache keying proves too complex in the short term, temporarily disable caching for these specific flows to guarantee fresh results.
*   **Establish Automated Performance Benchmarks & Tests:**
    *   **Action:** Implement automated tests to monitor the performance of critical components. This includes:
        *   Benchmarking AI flow execution times (e.g., using JavaScript benchmarking libraries).
        *   Tracking key visualization function performance and frame rates under defined conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Enables early detection of performance regressions, ensures AI and visualizer components remain efficient, and builds confidence in code changes.
*   **Implement In-Memory Cache Eviction Strategies:**
    *   **Action:** Address the unbounded growth of in-memory caches for AI flow results and generated visual assets. Implement cache eviction policies (e.g., Least Recently Used - LRU) or set maximum size limits.
    *   **Impact:** Prevents potential memory exhaustion during long user sessions, improving application stability and reliability.

### Medium-Priority / Strategic Plays
These recommendations involve more strategic efforts that will significantly improve the codebase's quality, maintainability, and the project's ability to evolve.

*   **Consolidate Repeated Logic & Configuration:**
    *   **Action:** Refactor duplicated logic and configuration. A prime example is the `defaultSafetySettings` array found in multiple AI flows; centralize this into a shared configuration module (e.g., `src/ai/sharedConstants.ts`). Externalize hardcoded prompt strings from flow definitions into a dedicated constants file or resource bundle.
    *   **Impact:** Enhances maintainability, reduces redundancy, simplifies updates, and prepares the codebase for potential internationalization.
*   **Implement Missing User-Facing QA Features:**
    *   **Action:** Prioritize the implementation of planned quality assurance and user experience features mentioned in `docs/blueprint.md`, such as:
        *   The "Adaptive Performance Watchdog" for real-time FPS monitoring and dynamic adjustment of visual complexity.
        *   The photosensitive epilepsy flash guard.
    *   **Impact:** Directly improves user safety, experience, and application robustness, especially on varying hardware capabilities.

    *   **Impact:** Provides deeper insights into AI model behavior over time, helps monitor for model drift, assists in evaluating prompt effectiveness, and supports better AI governance.

### Lower-Priority / Foundational Improvements
These are important for long-term health and scalability but can be phased in.

*   **Expand & Formalize Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Continue to enhance project documentation by:
        *   Adding more detailed inline code comments, especially for complex algorithms or non-obvious logic.
        *   Expanding `docs/blueprint.md` or creating detailed design documents for unimplemented features.
        *   Consider setting up a developer wiki or generating a static site from the `docs/` folder for easier navigation and contribution.
    *   **Impact:** Improves onboarding for new contributors, aids in long-term maintenance, and preserves project knowledge.
*   **Conduct Thorough Accessibility Audit:**
    *   **Action:** Perform a comprehensive accessibility audit that goes beyond current good practices. Focus specifically on areas like color contrast ratios, ARIA role implementation for custom components, and complex keyboard navigation flows within the visualizer and control panel.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures the application is usable by a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.
*   **Proactive Security Scanning (CodeQL):**
    *   **Action:** Integrate and regularly run GitHub’s CodeQL (or similar static analysis security testing - SAST) on the repository.
    *   **Impact:** Proactively identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, reducing risk.
*   **Systematic Issue Tracking & Public Roadmap:**
    *   **Action:** Create GitHub Issues for all identified bugs, refactoring needs (including the cache key issue), documentation gaps, and unimplemented features from `docs/blueprint.md`. Develop and publish a project roadmap with clear milestones.
    *   **Impact:** Improves project transparency, facilitates community contributions, and provides a clear path for future development.

## Risk & Mitigation
This section outlines potential risks identified during the project evaluation and suggests mitigation strategies to enhance the application's security, ethical considerations, accessibility, and performance.

### Security Risks & Mitigations
*   **User Inputs:** User inputs for AI prompts and application settings are generally not evaluated as code. However, caution is always advised with any user-supplied data.
*   **External AI Services:** All AI prompts are processed by an external service (Google Gemini). It is crucial to secure API keys (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) by storing them in environment variables and never committing them to version control.
*   **`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** The application uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the `<head>` for a CSS reset. The evaluation notes that this is with static content, making the direct XSS risk low in this specific instance.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust CSP to mitigate risks of XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While current text inputs seem primarily for Canvas/WebGL rendering (not direct HTML), any user-generated text that might be rendered directly into the UI in the future should be rigorously sanitized.
    *   **CodeQL Scans:** Regularly run CodeQL scans (or similar SAST tools) on the JavaScript/TypeScript codebase to automatically flag potential security issues, including any unsafe uses of `innerHTML` or vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

### Bias & Ethical AI Risks & Mitigations
*   **Thematic Guidance:** The AI's creative output is guided by the "Cosmic Grapevines" theme. While this provides a unique aesthetic, it's important to be mindful that the underlying Gemini model may carry inherent biases.
*   **Harm Reduction:** Existing safety filters in AI flows, designed to block harmful speech, are a good foundational practice.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement user controls to report problematic AI suggestions or provide feedback, and potentially allow users to overwrite or regenerate suggestions.
    *   **Prompt Content Review:** Periodically review prompt content for cultural sensitivity. For example, references like "Octavia Butler" might not be universally understood or could be perceived differently across cultures. Ensure prompts are inclusive and appropriate for a global audience.
    *   **Bias Detection (A/B Testing):** Consider A/B testing different prompt variations or model parameters to identify and mitigate potential biases in the generated outputs.

### Accessibility (a11y) Risks & Mitigations
*   **Existing Strengths:** The application demonstrates good accessibility practices, including a "Skip to main content" link, appropriately labeled form inputs in the control panel, and `alt` text for AI-generated image previews.
*   **Recommendations for Further Improvement:**
    *   **Color Contrast:** Systematically verify that all text and UI elements meet WCAG AA or AAA color contrast standards, especially with the dynamic HSL themes generated from `brandingConstants.ts`. Tools for automated contrast checking can be integrated into the design and development workflow.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements, including sliders, switches, and custom controls within the visualizer or control panel, are fully operable via keyboard.
    *   **ARIA Attributes:** Add descriptive `aria-labels` to icon-only buttons or interactive elements where the visual context alone may not be sufficient for users of assistive technologies.
    *   **Automated Checks:** Implement periodic automated accessibility checks (e.g., using tools like axe-core integrated into development or CI pipelines) to catch regressions.
