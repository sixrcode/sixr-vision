## Visualizer Presets In-Depth

Here's a closer look at the visual experiences offered by the built-in presets:

### 1. Spectrum Bars (`spectrum_bars`)
*Description:* Watch as the raw energy of your audio is translated into a dynamic cityscape of light. Each bar represents a distinct frequency band, pulsing and stretching in perfect sync with the music's heartbeat ‚Äì from the deepest bass rumbles to the highest cymbal shimmers. It's a classic, hypnotic visualization of sound made tangible, with colors that shift and intensify with the mood of the audio, often painting a vibrant, SBNF-themed palette across the screen.

### 2. Radial Burst (`radial_burst`)
*Description:* Feel the music explode outwards from a central cosmic core! With every beat, a nova of radiant particles erupts, painting the void with trails of light. Low frequencies create powerful shockwaves of particles, while higher tones scatter like stardust. The intensity and color of the bursts are deeply tied to the audio, creating an immersive, energetic bloom of audiovisual power, often reflecting the "Cosmic Grapevines" theme with rich purples, oranges, and stellar yellows.

### 3. Echoing Shapes (`echoing_shapes`)
*Description:* Dive into a mesmerizing dance of emergent geometry against a backdrop of subtly twinkling stars. Simple shapes ‚Äì circles, squares, triangles ‚Äì materialize from the ether, pulsing with the rhythm and glowing with vibrant, shifting colors inspired by the "Cosmic Grapevines" theme. Each beat sends out new forms that scale and fade, creating a layered, hypnotic tapestry that elegantly reflects the music's structure and energy.

### 4. Particle Finale (`particle_finale`)
*Description:* Brace yourself for a grand spectacle of cosmic fireworks! This preset unleashes a dense, swirling galaxy of particles that react dramatically to every nuance of the sound. Beats trigger explosive bursts, scattering particles across the screen like a stellar cataclysm, while sustained notes can create flowing nebulae of light. It's an intense, full-screen celebration of sound and motion, perfect for climactic moments, with colors that flare and shimmer through the SBNF palette.

### 5. Neon Pulse Grid (`neon_pulse_grid`)
*Description:* Step into a retro-futuristic landscape of pure energy. A vast grid of neon cells comes alive, each one pulsing and glowing in response to different frequencies. Bass notes send deep, resonant waves across the grid, mids create shimmering, interconnected patterns, and trebles make individual cells scintillate with sharp light. The grid itself forms an electrifying, digital soundscape, often bathed in cool blues, lavenders, and accented with fiery SBNF oranges.

### 6. Mirror Silhouette (`mirror_silhouette`)
*Description:* Become part of the art with this interactive preset. If your webcam is active, your silhouette is transformed into a captivating visual element, outlined by a shifting rim light or filled with a dynamic, nebula-like texture that responds to the music. The background might feature procedurally generated "Cosmic Grapevines" that gently grow or grape-like particles that cluster and pulse with the audio, creating a personal, expressive experience where your movement and the music intertwine.

### 7. Frequency Rings (`frequency_rings`)
*Description:* Witness sound rippling outwards like cosmic waves across a dark, starlit void. Concentric rings expand from the center, their color, thickness, and intensity driven by different audio frequencies. Deep bass notes create wide, powerful rings in rich SBNF purples or reds, mids generate vibrant circles of orange and yellow, and trebles send out delicate, shimmering ripples of lavender or blue. It's a beautifully minimalist yet impactful representation of sound's pervasive energy.

### 8. Strobe Light (`strobe_light`)
*Description:* Prepare for an intense, rhythmic experience. With every detected beat, the entire screen erupts in a powerful flash of light, its color often shifting with the audio's character ‚Äì perhaps a sharp white, a vibrant SBNF orange, or a cool lavender. This preset delivers a raw, energetic punch, ideal for high-energy music and creating a classic, pulsating club-like atmosphere. *(Use with caution if sensitive to flashing lights).*

### 9. Geometric Tunnel (`geometric_tunnel`)
*Description:* Embark on an exhilarating flight through an ever-shifting geometric wormhole. Rings and angular shapes, illuminated in vibrant neon hues from the SBNF palette, rush towards you, their forms and colors pulsing and twisting in sync with the music. The speed of your journey accelerates with the audio's intensity, and the camera's field of view might expand or contract with the beat, creating a thrilling, immersive voyage into a dynamic, digital dimension.

*   üö¶ **Production Safety** (watchdog, accessibility, minimal bundle bloat)
*   üõ† **Maintainability** (clear state boundaries, CLI-ready presets, AI extension path)

**Note on Initialization Prompts:**
An `InitPromptOverlay` component is rendered at a high level within the `AppContainer`. This overlay conditionally appears if microphone or camera permissions have not yet been granted, prompting the user to enable them. It interacts with `useAudioAnalysis` (for mic status/initialization) and `useSettingsStore` (for webcam status/enablement) to determine its visibility and to trigger the respective access requests. This ensures users are guided to enable necessary features for the application to function fully.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript) for the web interface. State management is handled primarily by **Zustand**, providing a lean and efficient way to manage global and local component states. Styling uses Tailwind CSS and custom fonts (primarily Poppins, with system fallbacks; thematic fonts like Data70 for titles). UI components leverage **ShadCN UI** (built on Radix UI primitives) for consistency, with icons from Lucide React. Recharts is used for visualizing data like audio waveforms or logs.
* **Graphics/Audio:** Uses the Web Audio API (FFT, energy analysis) for audio-reactive inputs, and Three.js/WebGL for 3D effects in all scenes. Webcam input is handled via HTML5 media APIs, with optional ML segmentation (planned).
* **AI/ML:** Google‚Äôs Gemini language model is accessed through the GenKit library (@genkit-ai/googleai) for tasks like scene suggestion and asset generation (e.g., style transfer (planned), color palettes, procedural asset image previews).
* **Backend / Database:** Firebase is used for authentication (planned) and data storage (e.g., IndexedDB for client-side rehearsal logs). The project is structured for Firebase Hosting / Functions. Development can use Firebase emulators for Auth and Firestore if backend features are added.
* **Development:** The codebase uses a Nix development environment (Node.js 20 and related packages). Development scripts (via `npm run dev`) start the Next.js server. GitHub Actions or the Firebase CLI can be used for deployment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Buttons ¬∑ active sliders ¬∑ focus rings
- Hover states ¬∑ progress bars
- Canvas & panel backdrop
- Typeface ‚Äî Poppins (primary sans-serif), Data70 (titles)
- Icons ‚Äî minimalist geometric line set (Lucide React)
- Layout ‚Äî split-screen: full-bleed visualizer + ~280-320 px control panel
- Motion ‚Äî 200 ms ease-out fades & slides; spring easing on slider thumbs

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sixrcode/sixr-vision.git
    cd sixr-vision
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment setup:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` or create a `.env.local` file.
    *   Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"` to this file. This is **required** for AI features.
    *   Add any other Firebase config variables (API keys, project ID, etc.) if you integrate Firebase backend services.
    *   (If using Nix: run `nix develop` to enter the environment with Node.js v20.)
4.  **Start development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This runs the app (by default on `localhost:9002`). Ensure any required services (like Firestore emulator or a Firebase project) are running if you've configured them.

## Usage

*   **Access the app:** Open your browser to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (or the configured host/port). You should see the SIXR Vision interface with a visualizer canvas and side control panel.
*   **Audio input / Webcam:**
    *   The visualizer reacts to audio.
    *   Play music on your device.
    *   **Enable Microphone:** Click the <kbd>Mic</kbd> icon in the Control Panel header. Allow browser permission when prompted.
        *   **Audio Source:** Select your desired input device from the "Audio Engine" section.
        *   **Gain/AGC:** Adjust sensitivity with "Manual Gain" or enable "Automatic Gain Control (AGC)".
        *   **Monitor Audio:** (Caution: Potential feedback!) Play microphone input through speakers.
    *   **Enable Webcam:** Click the <kbd>Camera</kbd> icon. Allow permission. Used by scenes like "Mirror Silhouette".
        *   **Mirror Toggle:** Flip the webcam feed horizontally in "Webcam Layer" controls.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **On first load, or if permissions haven't been granted, a prompt will appear asking for microphone and (optional) camera access. These are required to unlock the full visual and interactive experience. Click "Enable Mic" or "Enable Cam" on the prompt to grant access or retry if permissions were previously blocked.**
*   **Presets:** Click on scene thumbnails or press number keys **1‚Äì9** to load built-in scenes (see "Visualizer Presets In-Depth" for descriptions). Scenes cross-fade automatically if "Enable Scene Transitions" is active. Press **P** to blackout (panic mode), and **L** to toggle the SIXR logo blackout.
*   **AI tools:** Explore the "AI: ..." sections in the control panel. Use the Palette Genie, Procedural Assets generator, or let the AI suggest scenes. These may require a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. For example, try the SBNF-themed prompt "Cosmic Grapevines" for procedural assets.
*   **Remote control:** (Planned Feature) The app will listen for WebSocket/OSC commands. You'll be able to send commands like `{"route":"/preset","value":"radial_burst"}` to change scenes remotely. (An Art-Net lighting console will be able to send/receive as well.)
*   **Performance monitoring:** (Planned Feature) If you experience frame drops, an on-screen FPS display or heatmap will be available. A watchdog will attempt to self-adjust settings to recover smoothness. Use the IndexedDB logs (downloadable CSV from "System & Safety") to review performance over time.
